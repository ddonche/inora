        <!-- INTRO -->
        <section class="docSection" id="intro">
          <p>Citizenship in the Republic of Inora means something most governments stopped offering centuries ago: actual authority.</p>
          
          <p>Every citizen is a sovereign. Not symbolically. Constitutionally. Citizens collectively hold all governmental power. Officials are hired labor. They can be fired instantly. Laws can be vetoed. The agenda gets set by citizens, not politicians. This is not participatory democracy. This is distributed sovereignty.</p>
          
          <p>Most governments claim to derive authority from the people, then operate as if that authority transferred permanently the moment someone took office. Inora rejects that model entirely. Authority is loaned, not surrendered. It stays with citizens. Always.</p>
          
          <p>The difference is structural, not rhetorical. The constitution was written to prevent the usual decay. No immunity for officials. Universal recall. Citizen veto. Agenda control. These are not suggestions. They are the operating system.</p>

          <p>The Republic of Inora is building this system now as a digital nation. The civic forum launches in 2025. Founding citizens will govern, deliberate, and stress-test a constitutional framework designed for places where failure is not an option: isolated settlements, space colonies, post-catastrophe scenarios.</p>

        <!-- CORE STRUCTURE -->
        <section class="docSection" id="structure">
          <h2 class="docH">The Inoran Citizenship Model</h2>
          
          <p>The Republic of Inora separates participation from binding authority. Everyone has voice. Only those who demonstrate competence and accept responsibility exercise binding power. This separation exists to prevent corruption, inhibit power-seeking behavior, and ensure that decisions affecting others are made by citizens who understand the system they are operating within.</p>
          
          <p>Inora recognizes one citizenship. There are no classes of people with different moral standing, inherent rights, or legal personhood. Citizenship is voluntary, revocable only through full due process, never commodified, and never conditioned on ideology, wealth, popularity, or identity.</p>
          
          <p>What differs between citizens is which civic authorities they choose to exercise, not whether they are citizens.</p>
          
          <p>All citizens possess inherent civic authority by default. Some authorities are non-binding: voice, proposal, challenge. Others are binding: law, punishment, adjudication. Binding authority affects others and therefore requires demonstrated competence and acceptance of compulsory duty.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- PARTICIPANS -->
        <section class="docSection" id="participans">
          <h2 class="docH">Civis Participans</h2>
          <h3 class="docSH">Participating Citizen</h3>
          
          <p>This is the default civic status. A Civis Participans may observe all civic proceedings, speak, argue, object, and advocate, propose policies and challenge laws, participate fully in deliberation, represent others with informed consent, vote on agenda-setting and procedural initiation, vote on recall of officials, and access all civic materials and training.</p>
          
          <p>A Civis Participans does not exercise binding authority. They do not cast binding votes on laws, budgets, or sentencing frameworks, serve on decisive juries determining guilt or liability, or hold offices that execute final procedure.</p>
          
          <p>This is not a provisional or lesser status. A citizen may remain Civis Participans permanently.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- OPTIMO IURE -->
        <section class="docSection" id="optimo-iure">
          <h2 class="docH">Civis Optimo Iure</h2>
          <h3 class="docSH">Citizen with Binding Authority Enabled</h3>
          
          <p>This status enables binding civic authority. A Civis Optimo Iure may cast binding votes that enact law or allocate compulsory resources, serve on juries that determine guilt, liability, or sentence, serve on constitutional review panels, hold public office, and execute final procedural authority.</p>
          
          <p>This authority is not a privilege. It is a public obligation.</p>

          <p>With binding authority comes mandatory civic duty, including compulsory service rotations such as juries, review panels, and procedural roles, ongoing competency maintenance, public accountability for decisions, and immediate recall for neglect, abuse, or breach of trust.</p>

          <p>A citizen may relinquish this status at any time without losing citizenship.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- POWER BALANCE -->
        <section class="docSection" id="power-balance">
          <h2 class="docH">Power Balance</h2>
          
          <p>Civis Participans may vote on what issues advance to deliberation, what proposals proceed to drafting, recall of officials, and procedural triggers.</p>
          
          <p>Civis Optimo Iure may vote on final enactment of laws, budgets and compulsory allocations, sentencing frameworks, and binding outcomes.</p>
          
          <p>This ensures that authority may always be revoked by the people, even if it was granted through competency.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- ADVANCEMENT -->
        <section class="docSection" id="advancement">
          <h2 class="docH">Advancement to Binding Authority</h2>
          
          <p>Advancement is automatic and non-discretionary. There are no human gatekeepers.</p>
          
          <p>To enable binding authority, a citizen must satisfy both requirements: knowledge and practice.</p>

          <h3 class="docSH">Knowledge</h3>
          <p>Completion of a free, public civic curriculum. Demonstrated understanding of the Constitution, civic procedures, legal standards, and rights and limits of authority.</p>

          <h3 class="docSH">Practice</h3>
          <p>A documented record of good-faith civic participation. Demonstrated ability to reason coherently, apply procedure correctly, and engage constructively in deliberation.</p>

          <p>Evaluation assesses how a citizen reasons, not what they believe. No ideology tests. No popularity metrics. No discretionary approval.</p>
          
          <p>Upon meeting both requirements, binding authority is enabled automatically.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- DESIGN RATIONALE -->
        <section class="docSection" id="rationale">
          <h2 class="docH">Design Rationale</h2>
          
          <h3 class="docSH">Authority Is a Duty</h3>
          <p>Binding power is structured to be labor-intensive, recallable, non-prestigious, and time-consuming. This filters out those who seek power for status, comfort, or control.</p>

          <h3 class="docSH">Reluctant Governance</h3>
          <p>Inora favors citizens who govern because the work must be done, not because they want to rule. Authority exists to be exercised, then relinquished.</p>

          <h3 class="docSH">Universal Voice Preserved</h3>
          <p>No citizen loses voice for refusing authority. Dissent, critique, and challenge remain permanent civic rights.</p>

          <h3 class="docSH">Harm Is Gated, Not Participation</h3>
          <p>Participation is open. Binding decisions require competence. This is harm prevention, not elitism.</p>
          
          <p>In Inora, everyone gets a voice. Only those who accept responsibility get binding power. Authority is a duty, not a prize.</p>
