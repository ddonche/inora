</header>

<section class="docSection" id="overview">
  <h2 class="docH">Overview</h2>

  <p>The Iveki platform serves as the digital capital city of the Republic of Inora—a social network and governance laboratory where rational discourse is rewarded, competence is demonstrated through action, and citizenship is earned through merit.</p>

  <p>Iveki combines elements of Wikipedia (collaborative knowledge-building), Reddit (community discussion), and online learning platforms (structured skill progression) into a unified system governed by the Inoran Constitution and Bill of Rights.</p>

  <p>This is both a social network and a low-risk training ground for self-governance.</p>
</section>

<section class="docSection" id="how-it-works">
  <h2 class="docH">How It Works</h2>

  <h3 class="docSH">Social Learning Platform</h3>

  <p>Iveki is a platform where users:</p>

  <ul class="docList">
    <li>Create and share educational content</li>
    <li>Participate in structured discussions</li>
    <li>Ask and answer questions</li>
    <li>Collaborate on knowledge resources</li>
    <li>Debate policy and governance</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="docSH">Quality Over Engagement</h3>

  <p>Unlike traditional social media, Iveki does not optimize for engagement, virality, or time-on-platform.</p>

  <p>Instead, the platform rewards:</p>

  <ul class="docList">
    <li>Rational arguments supported by evidence</li>
    <li>Good-faith participation in discussions</li>
    <li>High-quality educational content</li>
    <li>Constructive criticism and peer review</li>
    <li>Intellectual honesty and self-correction</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="docSH">Constitutional Governance</h3>

  <p>All platform rules and moderation policies derive from the Inoran Constitution and Bill of Rights.</p>

  <p>Freedom of expression is protected. Censorship does not exist. Consequences are transparent and uniform.</p>

  <p>Users govern the platform through the same systems they will use to govern the Republic.</p>
</section>

<section class="docSection" id="merit-system">
  <h2 class="docH">Merit System</h2>

  <h3 class="docSH">How Merit Is Earned</h3>

  <p>Users earn merit through demonstrated competence:</p>

  <ul class="docList">
    <li><strong>Quality Content:</strong> Educational posts, well-researched answers, thoughtful analysis</li>
    <li><strong>Rational Discourse:</strong> Logical arguments, supported claims, acknowledgment of opposing views</li>
    <li><strong>Peer Recognition:</strong> Community upvotes on contributions</li>
    <li><strong>Community Contribution:</strong> Editing, fact-checking, educational participation</li>
    <li><strong>Intellectual Honesty:</strong> Correcting your own errors, changing position when evidence warrants</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="docSH">What Doesn't Earn Merit</h3>

  <p>Bad-faith behavior is not rewarded:</p>

  <ul class="docList">
    <li>Logical fallacies used repeatedly without correction</li>
    <li>Refusal to engage with counterarguments</li>
    <li>Misrepresentation of sources or opponents' positions</li>
    <li>Low-quality or unsupported claims</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Poor content isn't penalized—it simply doesn't earn merit. The algorithm favors strong arguments and quality content. Weak content gets naturally buried through lack of recognition.</p>

  <p>However, spam and platform rule violations are actively penalized through temporary restrictions and potential removal.</p>

  <h3 class="docSH">The Algorithmic Foundation</h3>

  <p>Merit is calculated algorithmically based on:</p>

  <ul class="docList">
    <li>Content quality scores (peer-reviewed)</li>
    <li>Argumentation quality (logical structure, evidence support)</li>
    <li>Community voting (one person, one vote)</li>
    <li>Contribution to knowledge resources</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The algorithm is public, auditable, and improvable through community governance.</p>
</section>

<section class="docSection" id="progression">
  <h2 class="docH">Progression Path</h2>

  <h3 class="docSH">Level 1: Observer</h3>

  <p>Privileges:</p>

  <ul class="docList">
    <li>Read all content</li>
    <li>Comment on discussions</li>
    <li>Ask questions</li>
    <li>Create posts and content</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Cannot participate in moderation</li>
    <li>Cannot vote on governance</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="docSH">Level 2: Contributor</h3>

  <p><strong>Earned through quality participation.</strong></p>

  <p>New privileges:</p>

  <ul class="docList">
    <li>Vote on content quality</li>

  </ul>

  <h3 class="docSH">Level 4: Moderator (Educator)</h3>

  <p><strong>Elected by Trusted Contributors based on demonstrated judgment and teaching ability.</strong></p>

  <p>Moderators are educators, not enforcers. Their role is to:</p>

  <ul class="docList">

    <li>Teach users about reasoning errors when flagged</li>
    <li>Provide educational feedback on arguments</li>
    <li>Guide community discussions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Moderators cannot ban users. Removal from the platform requires jury decision through due process.</p>

  <p>Moderators are subject to recall by the community.</p>

  <h3 class="docSH">Level 5: Citizen</h3>

  <p><strong>Earned through civic competency demonstration, training completion, and sustained contribution.</strong></p>

  <p>Requirements:</p>

  <ul class="docList">

    <li>Propose policy changes</li>
    <li>Run for elected positions</li>
    <li>Serve on juries for platform disputes</li>
    <li>Apply for formal citizenship in the Republic of Inora (optional)</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="docSection" id="citizenship">
  <h2 class="docH">Citizenship in the Republic</h2>

  <h3 class="docSH">Voluntary Association</h3>

  <p>Reaching Level 5 on Iveki demonstrates civic competency required for citizenship in the Republic of Inora.</p>

  <p>Citizenship is entirely voluntary. Level 5 users may:</p>

  <ul class="docList">
    <li>Remain platform participants without citizenship</li>
    <li>Apply for formal citizenship in the Republic</li>
    <li>Participate in governance without official status</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Citizenship grants:</p>

  <ul class="docList">
    <li>Voting rights in Republic-wide decisions</li>
    <li>Eligibility for government positions</li>
    <li>Access to civic dividend (when established)</li>
    <li>Full constitutional protections</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="docSH">Competency Verification</h3>

  <p>The Iveki merit system combined with formal training serves as the civic competency verification required by the Constitution.</p>

  <p>By reaching Level 5, users have demonstrated:</p>

  <ul class="docList">
    <li>Understanding of constitutional principles through training and testing</li>
    <li>Ability to engage in rational discourse through sustained track record</li>
    <li>Good-faith participation over time</li>
    <li>Respect for rights and due process</li>
    <li>Capacity for self-governance</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is not just a test to pass. This is training plus a track record to establish.</p>
</section>

<section class="docSection" id="governance">
  <h2 class="docH">Governance Rights</h2>

  <h3 class="docSH">Platform Governance</h3>

  <p>Level 5 users vote on:</p>

  <ul class="docList">
    <li>Platform rule changes</li>
    <li>Moderation policy updates</li>
    <li>Merit algorithm improvements</li>
    <li>Feature development priorities</li>
    <li>Community standards and guidelines</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="docSH">Republic Governance</h3>

  <p>Citizens participate in:</p>

  <ul class="docList">
    <li>Legislative proposals and votes</li>
    <li>Constitutional amendment processes</li>
    <li>Election of government officials</li>
    <li>Recall and veto mechanisms</li>
    <li>Judicial review participation (jury duty)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="docSH">Distributed Authority</h3>

  <p>The platform practices the distributed sovereignty model defined in the Constitution.</p>

  <p>Citizens don't just vote on laws—they participate in enforcement, adjudication, and governance improvement.</p>

  <p>This is training for actual self-governance.</p>
</section>

<section class="docSection" id="principles">
  <h2 class="docH">Core Principles</h2>

  <h3 class="docSH">Reason Over Emotion</h3>

  <p>The platform rewards logical arguments supported by evidence. Emotional appeals are not penalized but do not earn merit.</p>

  <h3 class="docSH">Free Speech, Real Consequences</h3>

  <p>You can say anything that doesn't constitute a credible threat or direct incitement to imminent criminal action. The community can respond, criticize, and downvote. Censorship does not exist.</p>

  <h3 class="docSH">Merit, Not Popularity</h3>

  <p>Quality content rises. Poor content sinks. The algorithm favors strong arguments and well-supported claims over viral content and engagement bait.</p>

  <h3 class="docSH">Transparency and Appeals</h3>

  <p>All moderation actions are public. All algorithmic decisions are explainable. All penalties can be appealed through jury process.</p>

  <h3 class="docSH">Educational, Not Punitive</h3>

  <p>When content is flagged for logical fallacies or reasoning errors, moderators provide educational feedback. The platform teaches users how to make better arguments, not just what they did wrong.</p>

  <h3 class="docSH">The Environment Teaches</h3>

  <p>Iveki creates an environment where rational discourse succeeds and bad-faith behavior fails. The platform teaches through structure, feedback, and consequences—not just lectures.</p>
</section>

<section class="docSection docEnd">
  <h2 class="docH">Join the Experiment</h2>

  <p>The Iveki platform launches in 2026.</p>

  <p>This is a social network and a governance experiment. A place where rational discourse is practiced, competence is demonstrated, and self-governance is tested in a low-risk environment.</p>

  <p>If you believe rational discourse can survive the internet, if you think competence should matter more than credentials, if you want to participate in building a better system—this is where it begins.</p>
